this api has to use websockets, with different endpoints for different bots?

websockets bcs of logging? actually could also add custom transport for winston

each session should have a unique identifier to then simplify debugging

on dropping the connection the tokens and proxies come back to owner?

gotta find a new proxy, cos the one used right now is expiring, could be the same one actually

got to also recognize the costs and see how the maintenance goes

still though main purpose is to finish the signup process, may need to find another number provider

all in all as I search for the provider this server can be sorted

it might be working on a local connection basis but I think it should have a domain and some sort of an api key

or could also create a big vpn to contain all of the architecture and make it speak localhost to each other

ye this is better idea

for the database dont need anything fancy, there will only be one database to start with

will just use sqlite :)

that is about it
